This package was written for the Week 4 final assignment, as part of the Johns Hopkins University \"Mastering Software Development in R\" specialization.\n\nThe Data\n\nThe data source of this package is given is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). These data list the fatal vehicle crashes in the United States each year between 2013 and 2015; each crash observation can have as many as 50 features.\n\nIn this package, the available years of data are: 2013-2015.\n\nAn example of the head of the 2013 data file is shown below:\n\nfile_2013 <- make_filename(2013)\nfars_2013 <- fars_read(file_2013) \ndim(fars_2013)\nfars_2013\nFor detailed information about the data, see the NHTSA FARS Manuals & Documentation page.\n\nLoading FARS Data\n\nIf you wish to load all of the data for a given year, use the make_filename() and fars_read() functions, as shown in the previous section. Pulling multiple years at a time drastically cuts down on most interesting information.\n\nAbout the Filename\n\nIf you wish, you can add more data to the package. You will need to find where the package data is stored on your machine. You can use the make_filename command to track this down:\n\nfile_2013 <- make_filename(2013)\nfars_2013\nThe danger with adding data in this way is that if you reinstall the package it may overwrite any new data you bring in.\n\nSingle Year\n\nIf you wish to just look at fatality data for a a single year, use the fars_read_years() function with a single year as input. The only data columns selected are MONTH and year. This returns a list of length one, and the first element in the list is the tbl_df (the tidyverse data frame) listing the month and year for each fatal accident. By itself, this data is relatively meaningless unless you want to count number of fatalities by month.\n\nfars_2014 <- fars_read_years(years = 2014)\nfars_2014[[1]]\nMultiple Years\n\nIf you wish to look at fatalities for multiple years, enter a vector of years as the argument for the fars_read_years() function (examples: fars_read_years(years = c(2013, 2015)) or fars_read_years(2013:2015). Again, this returns a list of tbl_dfs, with each element of the list showing the month and year for each fatality.\n\nfars_3yrs <- fars_read_years(years = 2013:2015)\nfars_3yrs\nSummarizing FARS Data\n\nThe fars_summarize_years() function take the same argument as the fars_read_years(), and produces a summary of the simple counts of fatalities by month and year:\n\nfars_summary <- fars_summarize_years(2013:2015)\nfars_summary\nMapping Fatal Crashes\n\nFinally, the fars_map_state function takes a state ID number and a year, and maps that state's fatalities with a dot at the fatality location. Note that in order to use this function, you will likely need to load the mapdata package.\n\nfars_map_state(53, 2014)\nfars_map_state(36, 2014)\n",
